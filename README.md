# AdventureBot
A twitch bot with permissions, modules, access control, and many more features.

## Setup
This bot requires a folder that isn't present, `node_modules`. The `node_modules` can be obtained after downloading [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and then running the following command `npm install tmi.js --save` in a command line of your choice. The `auth.json` file also needs to be modified before running this bot, the oauth variable inside that file needs to be edited before being run.

## Installation instructions
Keep in mind that this process requries you to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
In a command line of your choice, enter the following commands:
- `git clone https://github.com/iDiffusion/Adventure-Bot/` to download the project
- `cd Adventure-Bot` to open the new project directory made by GitHub
- `npm install tmi.js --save` to install its dependencies
- `node bot.js` to start the bot
Make sure to edit the `auth.json` file before running the bot, it will not work unedited.
