# AdventureBot

A twitch bot with permissions, modules, access control, and many more features.

## Setup

This bot requires a folder that isn't present, `node_modules`. The `node_modules` can be obtained after downloading [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and then running the following command [tmi.js](https://docs.tmijs.org/) in a command line of your choice. The `config.json` file also needs to be modified before running this bot; the name, channels and oauth variables inside that file needs to be edited before being run.

## Installation instructions (easy way)

Keep in mind that this process requires you to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

In a command line of your choice, enter the following commands:

-   `git clone https://github.com/iDiffusion/Adventure-Bot/` to download the project
-   `cd Adventure-Bot` to open the new project directory made by GitHub
-   `npm install tmi.js --save` to install its dependencies
-   `npm install pm2 -g` to install pm2, if you would like to run bot in the background.

Make sure to edit the `config.json` file before running the bot, it will not work unedited.

## Installation instructions (hard way)

Keep in mind that this process still requires `nodejs` and `tmijs` to be installed.

-   Navigate to the [Repository](https://github.com/iDiffusion/Adventure-Bot), if not already there.
-   Click `Clone or download` then `Download ZIP`.
-   Extract and open the folder.
-   Within the folder press and hold `shift` and `right-click` to open the options, then click `Open CommandPrompt window here`.
-   Type `npm install tmi.js --save` to install the bots dependencies.
-   Type `npm install pm2 -g` to install pm2, if you would like to run bot in the background.

## Usage

Before running the bot make sure that `config.js` has been setup properly, [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) has been downloaded and installed, and [tmi.js](https://docs.tmijs.org/) also been installed in the folder with the bot code.

-   To run `start.bat` click the executable file.
-   To run `startPM2.bad` make sure that [pm2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/) is installed then click the executable file.
